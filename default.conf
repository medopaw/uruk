# Uruk Default Configuration

# This file contains all available installation targets with descriptions.
# All targets are commented out by default to prevent accidental installation.
# 
# To enable targets, either:
# 1. Uncomment lines in this file, or
# 2. Create a custom.conf file with your desired targets
#
# If custom.conf exists, this file will be ignored.
